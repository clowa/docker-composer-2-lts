# docker-composer-2-lts

This repository contains a Dockerfile to build a PHP image with Composer 2 LTS support.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Composer in its latest version requires PHP 7.2.5 to run. A long-term-support version (2.2.x) still offers support for PHP 5.3.2+ in case you are stuck with a legacy PHP version. A few sensitive php settings and compile flags are also required, but when using the installer you will be warned about any incompatibilities.
